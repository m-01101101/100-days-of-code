## Main Commitment
*I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

### Day 0: 5th January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Implemented "Huffman coding" - a lossless data compression algorithm

**Thoughts:** Really out of practice of working with Trees and Queues so took me much longer than I would have liked. Cheated a little by using Python's built in `heapq` module. It provides a `min Heap` implementation. Good to get a bit more practice with recursion.

**Link to work:** The work is part of the Udacity "datastructures & algorithms" nanodegree [ref](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).
